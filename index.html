    <p>There are so many <em>Ultraman</em> series and specials, that it is hard to keep them apart. They all follow a central plot line, however, in which the Science Patrol must defend Earth from sinister monsters and aliens, by training a team of less sinister monsters and aliens. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> many of the monster costumes were reused multiple times, but spray painted different colours to appear different.</p>
        
      <p>The <em>Ultraman </em>television show first aired in 1966, and is on-going. At the time of writing, there have been 37 <em>Ultraman</em> series, 28 <em>Ultraman</em> movies, three television specials, three animated specials, three shorts, and twelve video games.  </p>
        <p>This is not unique in Japan, a country which has a history of creating exceptionally long-running children's television programs.</p>
